# bbcode-editor

This is a program designed to help people make BBcode easy.
The code was origionally made for a game called osu! as for the custom bbcode built in.

Not all the bbcode from this program will work everywhere as some is custom and not supported by most sites,
but it should be able to work with every site that uses the most common bbcode tags

For non osu! users use of the editor only is recommended as the HTML page is made to look and act as the osu profile page
